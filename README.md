ðŸ’¼ Customer Churn Prediction using ANN and Streamlit

Developed an end-to-end Customer Churn Prediction System leveraging deep learning and interactive visualization.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview:
Built a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using the Churn Modeling dataset. The workflow involved data preprocessing, encoding categorical variables, training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and deploying an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time prediction.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:

Performed data preprocessing using Label Encoding for Gender and OneHotEncoding for Geography.

Implemented a TensorFlow/Keras ANN with one hidden layer for churn classification.

Tuned model parameters and applied feature scaling for optimized learning.

Integrated callbacks such as EarlyStopping and TensorBoard for performance monitoring.

Built and deployed an intuitive Streamlit UI allowing users to input customer details and instantly predict churn probability.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Streamlit, Pickle

ðŸ”¹ Outcome:
Achieved a high-performing, production-ready model with a user-friendly interface â€” demonstrating a full ML lifecycle from data to deployment.
